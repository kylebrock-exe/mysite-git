# mysite-git
This is my project for Code Louisville's Front End class Summer 2020. I made a website to host the YouTube content I create, and to provide a platform for people to contact me. 
Project Requirements Met:
1) Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes. [Throughout the site]
2) Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout. [Throughout the site]
3) Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through. [On the ABOUT page]
