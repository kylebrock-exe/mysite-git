# mysite-git
This is my project for Code Louisville's Front End class Summer 2020. I made a website to host the YouTube content I create, and to provide a platform for people to contact me. 

STARING/VIEWING PROJECT:
1) Clone the repository from GitHub.
2) Open the index.html file in a browser.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
1) Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes. [Throughout the site]
2) Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout. [Throughout the site]
3) Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through. [On the ABOUT page]
4) Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input [On the CONTACT page]
5) Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action [RANDOM VIDEO BUTTON located in the FOOTER of every page]
6) Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it [The SCRIPT used for the RANDOM VIDEO BUTTON is an array]

FEATURES:
1) My site features a RANDOM VIDEO BUTTON at the bottom of each page that will, upon clicking, take the viewer to one of ten random videos from my YouTube page. It uses a JS array function. 
2) I have embedded every one of my YouTube playlists into divs on the LET'S PLAY page that will shift in layout between desktop and mobile devices. 
3) There is a contact form on the CONTACT that provides validation for messages and is linked to my e-mail account for my YouTube channel/social media.
