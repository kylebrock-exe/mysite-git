# mysite-git
This is my project for Code Louisville's Front End class Summer 2020. I made a website to host the YouTube content I create, and to provide a platform for people to contact me. 
Project Requirements Met:
1) Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes. [Throughout the site]
2) Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout. [Throughout the site]
3) Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through. [On the ABOUT page]
4) Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input [On the CONTACT page]
5) Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action [RANDOM VIDEO BUTTON located in the FOOTER of every page]
6) Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it [The SCRIPT used for the RANDOM VIDEO BUTTON is an array]
